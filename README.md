## Full Stack Infra Technical Test 01

This technical test is designed to allow you to quickly showcase your skills in designing system architecture. It should only take a roughly 1 hour to complete, please do not spend too much longer on it, we do NOT expect a perfect piece of work.

### Project Brief
You've been tasked with developing a CRM application for an investment fund management company. They have asked for a breakdown of the expected system architecture for such a application, and would like a drawing of how all the systems will likely interact.

Think about the requirements of the full application as a whole, so servers, database(s), load balancing, etc.
